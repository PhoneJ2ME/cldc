   * The problem this function must solve is to obtain a set of really
   * unpredictable bits for use in cryptography.
   * There is no portable solution to this problem.
   *
   * Current time MUST NOT be used for seed generation because time is
   * predictable with a good precision, the accuracy of measurement
   * is limited (for example, a function that returns time in microseconds
   * may be just multiplying tenths of second by 100000), which makes
   * the number of really unpredictable bits small.
   *
   * System configuration parameters also are not a suitable source
   * of randomness because they may be learned from real-world sources
   * or obtained by an installed MIDlet.
   * External events, such as network packet arrival times, can
   * also be manipulated by adversary.
