# This is a scenario file for automating LWUITDemo MIDlet.
# You can download LWUIT from
# https://lwuit.dev.java.net/
# This scenario was written for LWUIT release from 2008-08-14,
# so there is no guarantee that it will work for earlier or later
# releases.
# In order to use this scenario, make sure that SJWC is compiled
# with jpeg support.
# The "msec" argument for pen and key events specifies delay in
# milliseconds _before_ simulating that event. It is used to 
# give our MIDP implementation time to handle simulated events.
